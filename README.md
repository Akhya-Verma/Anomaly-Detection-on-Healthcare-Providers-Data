 # üè• Unsupervised Anomaly Detection on Healthcare Providers Data
This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to detect anomalies (e.g., fraud or unusual billing patterns) in Medicare healthcare providers‚Äô data.
By leveraging Autoencoders for anomaly detection, the system identifies providers whose financial or service-related data significantly deviates from normal patterns. This can assist in fraud detection, compliance monitoring, and improving data quality in healthcare.

## üöÄ Features
# Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
- Handled missing values and non-numeric entries
- Applied Label Encoding for categorical variables
- Normalized numerical data using MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler
- Reduced skewness and imbalance in feature distributions

# Outlier Detection Techniques Implemented
- Z-Score Method
- IQR Method
- Winsorization
- Autoencoder-based Anomaly Detection (final model)

# Anomaly Detection Models Explored:
- Isolation Forest ‚Äì for partition-based anomaly detection.
- DBSCAN ‚Äì for density-based clustering and outlier detection.
- KNN (Unsupervised Adaptation) ‚Äì for distance-based anomaly scoring.
- Autoencoders (Final Model) ‚Äì selected for their ability to learn compressed representations and reconstruct normal patterns effectively.


# Visualization & EDA
- Boxplots, scatter plots, distribution plots
- Correlation heatmap for feature relationships
- Bubble plots and animated scatter plots for anomaly visualization
- Funnel charts comparing different outlier detection methods

  
# Anomaly Detection with Autoencoders
- Trained an unsupervised Autoencoder model to reconstruct healthcare provider data
- Reconstruction error used as anomaly score
- High-error samples flagged as anomalies
  
# Interactive Input
- Users can input provider details (e.g., Medicare amounts, number of beneficiaries, gender)
- The model predicts whether the entry is anomalous or non-anomalous
  
# TF-IDF Analysis
 - Text data (e.g., HCPCS descriptions) vectorized using TF-IDF
- Heatmap visualization of most frequent terms
